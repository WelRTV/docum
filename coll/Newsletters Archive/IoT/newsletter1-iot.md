Enterprise IoT Could Open Up Worrisome Attack Vectors
by @sadie-williamson https://hackernoon.com/@sadie-williamson

Hackers can easily intercept information from the devices themselves or during transmission. They can also targetvthe servers or storage services to which IoT data is transmitted. Espionage and Sabotage. Enterprises are now popular targets for espionage and sabotage. American tech companies, for example, are known to be the focus of state-sponsored
attacks as part of cyberwarfare. Attacks on large enterprises can be
significant enough to affect the economy.

"Impact of IoT from Recruiting to the Final Product"
https://hackernoon.com/impact-of-iot-from-recruiting-to-the-final-product-2fl32mt
Technology and tools can use IoT to automatically manage and track inventory. They can track when new inventory comes in, when it goes, where it’s all going and a variety of other things. Not only will this greatly improve efficiency and streamline the process, but it will also reduce the chance of errors occurring as frequently. It will also free up time for employees to work on more important and challenging tasks.

"Home Cooling Fan Made Smart with JavaScript [Tutorial]"
https://hackernoon.com/how-we-made-a-home-cooling-fan-smart-with-javascript-5lw37q5
The Tessel is the CPU of our setup. This is what we will ship JavaScript to setup a network access point, control the I/O devices (eg the relay) etc. Basically, this is the board that replaces the chip we pulled out earlier.
The black rectangle plunging out of the board (picture coming soon below) is where you connect your input and output devices. This is where we will connect the relay to. You can also connect sensors, displays, and other accessories using this port.
The saint smart 4 pin relay module is a separate hardware device that takes instruction from a 5v chip, for example Tessel 2, and uses the instruction to control high voltage devices of up to 240v (eg. fan). With out the relay the micro-controller can only control devices of 5v and below.

The Internet of Things will Transform these 7 Industries"
https://hackernoon.com/the-internet-of-things-will-transform-these-7-industries-4o48b3roy
Smart cities use IoT sensors to measure and optimize water use, energy use, waste management, traffic, air quality and other important city processes. We are only part of the way through a strong urbanization trend. The United Nations expects 68% of the world’s population to live in urban areas by 2050. Smart cities will help mitigate the resulting strain on infrastructure and resources.

Transforming the Internet of Things (IoT) to Value of Things (VoT)

The overall review of Waltonchain can be summarized as a game-changer. With the use of seminal technologies like Blockchain and RFID technologies, the Waltonchain is slated to transform the Internet of Things (IoT) to Visions for the Internet of Things (VIoT) and solve all challenges being faced by it. It is only a matter of time when it realizes the goals of inculcating architectural flexibility, ensuring high scalability and data uniformity, transforming the IoT security and reducing overall costs.

Happy Birthday, Internet!

I still remember the first time I was able to surf the web in the early
1990’s with a modem and by paying access through a toll/surcharged
number with AOL. The model worked for some time and service providers
were distributing free CD-Roms in magazines to advertise and popularize
the access.

How IoT Context Awareness & The Catapult Blockchain Solve the menace of ATM Skimming

If the IoT Skin detects any objects being placed over certain areas, such as near the card reader or keypad, for an extended amount of time, the ATM’s owner is notified to examine the ATM for skimmers. To combat shimmers, part of the Skin is placed on the inside of the card reader itself.

Could the Tech in "Tomorrowland" Movie Become a Reality by 2050?
Fiction shows us what our cities, vehicles, and coworkers could become, challenging the best of the best to make today’s fantasy tomorrow’s reality. But Tomorrowland is hardly Todayland in many ways, and it maybe not be so even by 2050.

Getting Started with Home Automation

Before you go out and buy the Phillip Hues light bulbs, please allow me to stop you before you head out the door. The absolute quickest and easiest thing to do is buy the Phillips light bulbs. However, don’t, unless you live in an apartment. They are a hack in my opinion and here’s why. If you put a Phillips Hue light bulb in your house and someone turns the switch off at the wall, guess what? You cannot turn the light back on.

How Local Governments are Future-Proofing their Urban Centres with Blockchain Technology

Food is harvested through vertical farming installations built inside old shipping containers using hydroponic methods on a fully automated basis, with no need for human intervention. Their water system extracts 15 gallons of drinking water per day from the air, using a solar-powered system that requires little maintenance, with all water being recycled. The project is on track to be completed by 2020, so stay tuned for more on this one.
