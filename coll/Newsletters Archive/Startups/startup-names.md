Become an Idea Generator via the S.C.A.M.P.E.R. Method

This method was initially theorized by Alex Faickney Osborn in 1953 (the OG inventor of the term "brainstorming", yup). Subsequently the SCAMPER was taken up and reworked in numerous texts and studies concerning the generation of ideas and the creative approach to business problems (for example I discovered it by reading the excellent text by Michael Michalko, Thinkertoys).

Growth of Vertical SaaS Challenges Market Leaders, Benefits Startups

For the last few years, it's hard to argue that big horizontal SaaS providers have been anything less than dominant. Backed by some of the largest and most well-capitalized businesses in the world, they have the resources to push their way into multiple industries without breaking a sweat. At the same time, however, vertical SaaS providers have seen an explosion in growth and investment activity. All signs point to it becoming the hotter of the two approaches in the coming years.

How Setting up a Company in the US Helps Startups Scale

5 Reasons Why Your Business Needs VR Today

For example, if you own construction business and frequently work on large projects with many phases that require significant time and investment, it can be difficult to give your clients a true sense of what the finished product will look like. This issue can be solved by creating a VR model of the completed building.

Need a startup idea? Start with a problem.

Generally, my team and I following these steps:

Before even thinking about solutions, we try to identify domains where problem solving might be needed.
We get out and observe and talk to people in those domains. We try to understand what they do and the pain points they face.
We identify a problem which is: A) Easy to describe; B) Causing significant challenges for people or businesses; D) So serious, people or businesses are willing to pay to have it solved
Once we clearly understand the problem, then we brainstorm many possible solutions to that problem. We then focus on solutions which can be quickly implemented and deployed to clients

We called our solution “CabPool.” A very clever twist on the phrase “carpool.” People would use an app to find others going to the same place as them and share a cab, splitting the cost.

Online Business Ideas to Earn Extra Money In 2019

Mirrorless camera saw their sales increase of 16,5% in the United States, resulting in a reduction of the sales of DSLR. In 2015, the popularity of mirrorless cameras led to a 21% drop in sales for Canon, which offered a collection of lower performing DSLR cameras. Despite a large number of people using their phones as cameras, mirrorless cameras have managed to create their own commercial niche.

The Thought Process Behind Startup Ideas

Initially, it sounds discouraging that a major industry player failed to implement something similar.

But to me, that’s an encouraging sign.

Large companies fail to innovate because they’re great at what they do. But they’re not organized to develop and distribute the latest technology.

10,000+ Personalized Business Ideas Using Heuristics

Anchor bias is a cognitive trait that leads us to put too much emphasis on information we discover first. Our thought processes are anchored to that early information and subsequent information is viewed with this bias in mind.
This is exactly the same concept we are going to build in to our heuristic business idea generator because we want it to be bias (or personalized) toward ourselves.

https://hackernoon.com/the-mvp-is-dead-long-live-the-rat-233d5d16ab02
An MVP seduces with false reassurances of a clear, linear path to an optimised solution. A Riskiest Assumption Test puts the focus on learning. It is a candle in the darkness that allows us to move forward one step at a time. Once you’ve validated the riskiest assumption you can move on to the next largest one. Gradually building confidence in the viability of your idea.
The MVP is dead. Long live the RAT.

What does it mean to be an Open Startup?

It has been suggested that Open Startup pages are purely a marketing strategy and nothing more. This may have some grains of truth to it for some early stage startups or side projects.
Sharing statistics via an open page or on Twitter does help with promotion and can increase traffic when metrics are shared. It depends on how you measure success, but for recently launched products the metrics don’t show enough data to determine sustained growth.

In initial days, you should target one specific set of customers, who would be willing to use the product and pay for it, its this segment of users that you are building the product for. When Facebook was launched in 2004, it targeted only students from Harvard University. Then they moved on to other universities before opening up for everyone else. This helped gain valuable insights and helped serve the initial smaller set of target audience really well.

Six Crucial Startup Lessons I Would Share With My Younger Self

Traditionally a business would spend a significant amount of time and money designing and developing a new product. Product development, on an entrepreneur’s budget, is crippling (in terms of time, cost and effort). 
It’s far easier to create a landing page that describes the product and offers a free trial or early adopter discount — as soon as it becomes available — for people who sign up.

Once you’ve conceptualized the idea, it’s time to build a product roadmap. Basically, it is a strategic plan of your product development which contains all the key stages, plans, and business objectives. Why do you want to launch your product? Who is your target audience? Where do you start? Include these and other details regarding timing, product vision, and metrics into the roadmap.

How I Built and Shipped My Revenue-Ready MVP in 4 Hours By Using Low-Code Approach

Step 3: 00:01:30–03:00:00
Once my list of user stories was complete, I was ready to dive into the build. This included creating all the pages the platform would need, alongside creating the database structure and functionality present on each page.
This whole process took a good few hours, as there was a lot of tinkering about on my end trying to get everything working properly. I also got stuck on a few things where I had a good idea of what needed to happen, but not how to do it on Boundless.

Consider the entrepreneurial journey of Taylor Offer who sold millions of dollars of socks. Socks may not be the sexiest of products, but it doesn’t take a ton of capital to get started. The business like that relies on design, branding and marketing above all else. You can do those things well without a lot of money, initially.

What I mean to say is you don’t need anything special, I personally use a tool called draw.io, it’s a free, cloud-based, flowchart maker and helps me visualise ideas from my brain in a more permanent way.

Any results and insights gained from a No-Product launch will be much cleaner and more de-noised than usually obtained via a typical MVP, which inevitably boxes customer feedback into focusing on the product itself as opposed to the value proposition at the core of your business hypothesis.

It is easy for both technical and non-technical people to overestimate or underestimate a product’s requirements. This is of course not to say that tech-savy managers, marketers or consultants shouldn’t have a say on the requirements, but that there is the need of a figure with a little bit of both backgrounds to understand the bigger picture and manage expectations with an eye for technical feasibility.
