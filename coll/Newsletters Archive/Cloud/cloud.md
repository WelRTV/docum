https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-a-website-using-google-cloud-7a9vh2323

Some notable companies using Google Cloud Platform (App Engine or Compute Engine) include HSBC, Home Depot, Spotify, HTC, Best Buy, Snapchat, Coca Cola, Domino’s, Philips, Feedly, Sony Music, ShareThis, and Ubisoft. Moreover, Apple has also been seen moving some of its services away from Amazon Web Services, spending between $400 million & $600 million on the Google Cloud Platform; although this could not be independently confirmed.

Refactor: The application is re-architected using the cloud-native features. Developers may reuse the language, or use cloud-native features, frameworks, or containers (Platform-as-a-Service or PaaS). This is often expensive, but usually, it is chosen when you opt to address new business requirements by adding new features or want to enhance the scalability and performance of the application.
